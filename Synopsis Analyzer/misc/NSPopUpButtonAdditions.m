		//	created and added to the fucking menu.  really love to know the rationale behind this.
		
		//	seriously, i don't know what to do here.  we just can't use pop-up buttons, i guess?  we
		//	work around this in vdmx by having a custom pop-up button that doesn't inherit (we create 
		//	and open the NSMenu programmatically, like it's a contextual menu, and the UI item is basically 
		//	an NSControl subclass, so it behaves more like an NSButton/NSSlider with respect to target/action)
		
		[self selectItem:n];	//	doesn't actually do diddly-shit.  WTF.
	}
	
	//	..and even though the item appears to be selected with pull-down NSPUBs, it's NOT ACTUALLY SELECTED AT ALL
	//	(look at the actions in AppDelegate- the selectedItem property of the NSPUB is always nil)
	
	//	call my target/action, passing myself
