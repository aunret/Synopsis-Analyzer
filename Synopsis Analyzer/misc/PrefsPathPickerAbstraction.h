/*
		several places in the prefs & app have a UI that requires the user to select a target folder.  this
	is an abstraction that manages a number of UI items that work cohesively to provide the user with a
	simplified workflow for specifying that target folder.
 
		features:
	- populates a pop-up button with menu items for choosing between "no special location",
	"custom location" (triggers an NSOpenPanel), or a list of recently-chosen locations
	- populates "statusButton" with a colored icon indicating the state of the UI item (grey for "no
	special location", red for a location that cannot be found, or green for a custom specified location)
	- populates "statusTextField" with the custom specified location (or a note indicating that no special location has been chosen)
	- responds to a "reveal button" that shows the selected location in the finder (or does nothing if no location is chosen)
	- lets the dev provide a block for opening a custom NSOpenPanel for selecting the location
	- lets the dev provide a block for responding to the user changing the specified location
 
		how to use it:
	- make an instance of this class in IB
	- wire up the outlets of this class to the corresponding UI items
	- connect the reveal button's action to - (IBAction) revealButtonUsed:(id)sender;
	- in your app's "awakeFromNib" method:
		- call -[PrefsPathPickerAbstraction setUserDefaultsKey:XXX] with the relelvant key value.  this key
		determines where your value will be stored in the NSUserDefaults.
		- set the "openPanelBlock" property- this block should open a customized NSOpenPanel that allows
		the user to select a target folder.  within the NSOpenPanel's completion block, be sure to
		call -[PrefsPathPickerPUB setPath:] (this passes the selected path back to the abstraction)
		- set the "pathChangeBlock" property- this block is called every time the instance's path is changed
	- you're basically done: if -[PrefsPathPickerAbstraction enabled] returns YES, you need to store the file
	somewhere other than adjacent to the source file, and you can call -[PrefsPathPickerAbstraction path] to
	get the specified location.
